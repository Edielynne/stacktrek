    <h1>Trees<br></h1>
    <br>
    <p>I think that I shall never see<br/>
        A poem lovely as a tree.<br/></p>
<br>
    <p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br/>
        Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;<br/></p>
<br>
     <p>A tree that looks at God all day,<br/>
        And lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br/></p> 
<br>
    <p>A tree that may in Summer wear<br/>
        A nest of robins in her hair;<br/></p>
<br>
    <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br/>
        Who intimately lives with rain.<br/></p>
<br>
    <p>Poems are made by fools like me,<br/>
        But only God can make a tree.<br/></p>
